we start off making a small game using HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT
First we invoke basic design for our tiles(small blocks) and the board

div#board{
	background-color: #ccc;
                     border: #999 1px solid;
	width: 800px;
	height: 540px;
	padding: 24px;
	margin: 0px auto;
}	

the above snippet is for the design end of the board 
the board is of  light grey (you can find color codes from w3schools.com)
the board is of width 800 px and heigh 540 px 
thats the basic info you need about the board


 div#board>div{
 	background:url("images/question_mark.png") no-repeat;
 	border:#000 1px solid;
 	width: 71px;
 	height: 71px;
 	float: left;
 	margin: 10px;
 	padding: 20px;
 	font-size: 64px;
 	cursor: pointer;
 	text-align: center;
 }

the above code is for our TILES or the small blocks in which a letter or image is placed
the intial image is of a question mark .. given by the  back ground url 
with width and height  and margin is used to invoke a gap from one element to other with desired value
cursor is not important ( i just did it to make it look good) 
cursor property is used when you want different cursor when you roll your mouse over a image or div or text
and text-align property is used for alignment of text inside the block or on tile
